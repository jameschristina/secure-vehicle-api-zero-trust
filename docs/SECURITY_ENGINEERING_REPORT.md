# Executive Summary

This project demonstrates the progressive transformation of a vulnerable vehicle command API into a Zero Trust–inspired cyber-physical security platform.

The project was intentionally developed in multiple phases to illustrate how security controls evolve from basic authentication into a modern Security Operations Center (SOC) ecosystem capable of:

- Identity verification
- Authorization enforcement
- Threat detection
- Threat hunting
- Incident response
- SOAR automation
- Threat intelligence correlation
- Detection engineering
- Cloud security controls
- Kubernetes security monitoring
- Endpoint detection and response
- Attack path analysis
- Purple team validation
- AI-assisted SOC analysis

The project is intended for cybersecurity education, portfolio demonstration, and security engineering research.

# Zero Trust Principles Implemented

The project incorporates several Zero Trust concepts.

## Verify Explicitly

Every request requires authentication.

Examples:

- API keys
- Identity federation simulation
- Device validation

## Least Privilege

Authorization policies restrict users to specific vehicle resources.

Examples:

- Role-based permissions
- Vehicle ownership restrictions
- Administrative separation

## Assume Breach

The system continuously evaluates telemetry for suspicious behavior.

Examples:

- Brute-force detection
- Authentication anomalies
- Privilege abuse detection
- Baseline deviation detection
