# Secure Vehicle API: Zero Trust + Behavioral Detection Simulation

## Overview

This project is a multi-phase cybersecurity simulation demonstrating how weak identity validation, broken access control, and limited observability can create cyber-physical risk in connected vehicle systems.

The project progressively evolves from a deliberately vulnerable API into a Zero Trust-oriented architecture with SIEM/UEBA-style behavioral detection, detection engineering, threat hunting, incident response automation, and threat intelligence correlation.

# Project Phases

## Phase 1 — Vulnerable Baseline

* Flask API with unrestricted access
* Endpoints:

  * `/status`
  * `/unlock`
  * `/start`
* Access controlled only by vehicle identifiers
* No authentication
* No authorization
* No rate limiting

### Security Weaknesses Demonstrated

* Broken access control
* Predictable identifiers
* Unauthenticated API access
* Lack of observability

---

## Phase 2 — Authentication + Rate Limiting

* Added API key authentication
* Added request rate limiting
* Added structured security logging
* Added security response headers

### Security Concepts

* Identity validation
* API hardening
* Abuse prevention
* Request attribution

---

## Phase 3 — Authorization + Least Privilege

* Added entitlement enforcement
* Mapped identities to authorized vehicles
* Blocked unauthorized cross-vehicle access
* Added authorization-aware logging

### Security Concepts

* Authentication vs authorization
* Least privilege
* Entitlement enforcement
* Zero Trust architecture

---

## Phase 4 — SIEM / UEBA-Style Detection

* Added live SIEM-style polling engine
* Added weighted risk scoring
* Added cumulative identity risk tracking
* Added alert classification
* Added behavioral anomaly detection
* Added live SIEM snapshots
* Added alert suppression cooldown logic

### Detection Concepts

* Behavioral analytics
* Identity-centric monitoring
* Security event correlation
* Risk aggregation
* SIEM/UEBA-style observability

### Sample Security Events

* Unauthorized vehicle access attempts
* Invalid API key detection
* Missing API key detection
* Identity-centric behavioral monitoring
* Risk-scored SIEM alerts

### Generated Security Visualizations

See `/screenshots` for:

* Request distribution charts
* Vehicle access activity
* Security failure analytics

---

## Phase 5 — Detection Engineering + MITRE ATT&CK Correlation

* Added detection engineering workflows
* Added MITRE ATT&CK tactic mapping
* Added event correlation logic
* Added severity-based alert prioritization
* Added structured detection analytics

### Detection Engineering Concepts

* MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping
* Detection logic engineering
* Threat classification
* Alert prioritization
* Correlation analytics

---

## Phase 6 — Threat Hunting

* Added proactive threat hunting workflows
* Added suspicious identity analysis
* Added anomalous behavioral pattern discovery
* Added historical event analysis
* Added IOC-style hunting logic

### Threat Hunting Concepts

* Proactive security analysis
* IOC discovery
* Behavioral hunting
* Threat pattern analysis
* Adversary detection workflows

---

## Phase 7 — SOC Incident Response Automation

* Added automated incident response workflows
* Added alert triage workflows
* Added incident severity scoring
* Added automated containment recommendations
* Added incident response reporting

### Incident Response Concepts

* SOC workflows
* Alert triage
* Incident classification
* Response orchestration
* Security operations automation

---

## Phase 8 — Threat Intelligence Correlations

* Added threat intelligence correlation engine
* Added IOC matching workflows
* Added suspicious IP reputation analysis
* Added threat feed enrichment logic
* Added behavioral-to-threat correlation
* Added intelligence-based severity scoring

### Threat Intelligence Concepts

* Threat intelligence integration
* IOC correlation
* Threat enrichment
* Intelligence-driven detection
* Adversary infrastructure analysis
* Security event correlation
