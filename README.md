# Secure Vehicle API: Zero Trust + Behavioral Detection Simulation

## Overview

This project is a multi-phase cybersecurity simulation demonstrating how weak identity validation, broken access control, and limited observability can create cyber-physical risk in connected vehicle systems.

The project progressively evolves from a deliberately vulnerable API into a Zero Trust-oriented architecture with SIEM/UEBA-style behavioral detection, detection engineering, threat hunting, incident response automation, and threat intelligence correlation.
