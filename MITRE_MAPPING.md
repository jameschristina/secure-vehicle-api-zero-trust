# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## Overview

This document maps Secure Vehicle API Zero Trust detections and simulated attack scenarios to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.

## Detection Mapping

| Detection Type | ATT&CK Technique | Technique Name |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Brute Force | T1110 | Brute Force |
| Privilege Abuse | T1068 | Exploitation for Privilege Escalation |
| Unauthorized Access | T1078 | Valid Accounts |
| Account Discovery | T1087 | Account Discovery |
| Credential Access | T1003 | OS Credential Dumping |
| Command Execution Abuse | T1059 | Command and Scripting Interpreter |
| Lateral Movement Simulation | T1021 | Remote Services |
| Suspicious Authentication Activity | T1078 | Valid Accounts |
| Device Change Detection | T1098 | Account Manipulation |
| Baseline Deviation Detection | T1036 | Masquerading |

## Defensive Coverage

Implemented project phases provide coverage across:

- Initial Access
- Execution
- Persistence
- Privilege Escalation
- Defense Evasion
- Credential Access
- Discovery
- Lateral Movement
- Collection
- Command and Control

---

## Security Engineering Value

Using ATT&CK mapping provides:

- Threat-informed defense
- Detection validation
- SOC analyst context
- Security architecture alignment
- Executive reporting consistency

This mapping demonstrates how project detections align with recognized industry threat models.
