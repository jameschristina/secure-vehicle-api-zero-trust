## Executive Summary

Secure Vehicle API: Zero Trust Security Operations Platform is a cybersecurity engineering project that demonstrates the evolution of a vulnerable vehicle control API into a Zero Trust–aligned Security Operations ecosystem.

The project progresses through twenty security phases covering:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Detection Engineering
- Threat Hunting
- Incident Response
- Threat Intelligence
- SOAR Automation
- Machine Learning Detection
- Cloud Security
- Identity Federation
- Kubernetes Security
- EDR Simulation
- Purple Team Operations
- AI-Assisted SOC Analysis

The vehicle API serves as the attack surface while the Security Operations Center (SOC) components provide visibility, detection, investigation, response, and reporting capabilities.

This repository is intended as a cybersecurity engineering and SOC simulation platform for demonstrating modern defensive security concepts rather than a production vehicle control system.
