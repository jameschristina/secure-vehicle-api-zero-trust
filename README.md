## Executive Summary

Secure Vehicle API: Zero Trust Security Operations Platform is a cybersecurity engineering project that demonstrates the evolution of a vulnerable vehicle control API into a Zero Trust–aligned Security Operations ecosystem.

The project progresses through twenty security phases that collectively demonstrate the implementation of Zero Trust Architecture through Detection Engineering, Threat Hunting, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, SOAR Automation, Identity Security, Cloud Security, Kubernetes Security, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Purple Team Operations, and AI-assisted SOC workflows.

Using a vehicle API as the attack surface, the platform demonstrates how modern security teams implement layered defensive controls, continuous monitoring, threat detection, automated response, and security analytics across an evolving enterprise environment.

This repository serves as a cybersecurity engineering and SOC simulation platform for demonstrating modern defensive security operations, security architecture, and Zero Trust principles rather than a production vehicle control system.

## Collaboration Acknowledgment

Secure Vehicle API: Zero Trust Security Operations Platform was collaboratively developed by Chukwuemeke Ikpeasonim and Christina James.

The project combines expertise in Zero Trust Architecture, Identity and Access Management, Detection Engineering, Threat Hunting, Incident Response, and Security Operations to demonstrate the evolution of a vulnerable vehicle API into a layered security ecosystem.

The resulting platform demonstrates the practical application of Zero Trust principles across identity, detection, response, automation, cloud-native security, and SOC operations within a simulated cyber-physical environment.
